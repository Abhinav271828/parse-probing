A study of internal representations of models trained to parse PEGs.

# Files
* `peg.hs`: Define PEG data structure and parser.
* `generation.hs`: Define five grammars and iterate over all strings of a fixed length.
* `generate.sh`: Iterate over all strings of a fixed length (too slow).
* `generation.py`: Randomly create grammars according to a distribution (useless).
